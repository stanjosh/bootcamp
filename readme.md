# Prework readme - For great learning

#### Or "How I learned to stop using Notepad++ and instead use VS Code"


***

The purpose of this readme is to familiarize myself with how the Markdown syntax boogies a little bit

I can't quite figure out the line breaks but that's no big deal.

Anyway, here's a list of things I'm working on here:

1. a list of things I'm learning, such as this list, whilst type it
2. this is the second item in said list
   * this is an unordered sub list of that, using three leeding spaces (for aesthetic) and an asterisk
   + and another item, with three leading spaces and a plus
   - some more stuff, and this one uses a minus, because there's no difference
1. I used a one on this line but since it's the third in an ordered list, it just used that index
   1. but sublists can
   2. be in
   3. order  
   oh, I've figured out line breaks now. two trailing spaces on the last line  
   this stays within the same paragraph

and this breaks out, cool.  


## Next section header! Some links

[This works a little like bbcode from forums back in the day](https://www.reddit.com "the home page of the internet")

[link to a blank file in the relative directory](./start-first-day.txt)

a little code block is fenced with three backticks
```python
borscht = {'food type': 'soup', 'temperature': 'cold', 'main ingredient': 'beets', 'opinion': 'gross'}
print(f"the {borscht['food type']} is {borscht['temperature']} "
      f"and made with {borscht['main ingredient']}, which is {borscht['opinion']}")


```
