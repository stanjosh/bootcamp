# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

N/S

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.

# Prework readme - For great learning

#### Or "How I learned to stop using Notepad++ and instead use VS Code"


***

The purpose of this readme is to familiarize myself with how the Markdown syntax boogies a little bit

I can't quite figure out the line breaks but that's no big deal.

Anyway, here's a list of things I'm working on here:

1. a list of things I'm learning, such as this list, whilst type it
2. this is the second item in said list
   * this is an unordered sub list of that, using three leeding spaces (for aesthetic) and an asterisk
   + and another item, with three leading spaces and a plus
   - some more stuff, and this one uses a minus, because there's no difference
1. I used a one on this line but since it's the third in an ordered list, it just used that index
   1. but sublists can
   2. be in
   3. order  
   oh, I've figured out line breaks now. two trailing spaces on the last line  
   this stays within the same paragraph

and this breaks out, cool.  


## Next section header! Some links
# Header lines are additive!


[Inline link to google with a title](https://www.google.com "this has a title!")  

[This works a little like bbcode from forums back in the day](https://www.reddit.com "the home page of the internet")

[link to a blank file in the relative directory](./start-first-day.txt)

<https://stanjosh.github.io> angular brackets just make a plain link


a little code block is fenced with three backticks
```python
borscht = {'food type': 'soup', 'temperature': 'cold', 'main ingredient': 'beets', 'opinion': 'gross'}
print(f"the {borscht['food type']} is {borscht['temperature']} "
      f"and made with {borscht['main ingredient']}, which is {borscht['opinion']}")


```
